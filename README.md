# SQL Project _ Healthcare Database

**1. Database Idea:**

We created a database that records the healthcare information of patients in fictional hospital named Happiness. The database reflects the healthcare industry’s key aspects in the 
following ways:
- Healthcare information of patients: The database contains tables of patient healthcare information which are designed to store detailed patient records including personal information, demographics, medical history, blood type and health insurance information. Recording and maintaining patient 
healthcare information is crucial for providing medical care. It allows the healthcare provider to 
have access to patients’ medical history, treatments, reducing the risk of medical errors and 
improving hospital services.
- Geographical information: The database includes geographic data such as region, country, and 
city. These data connected with detailed information of hospital data illustrate information of 
hospital locations around the world, allowing the hospital to manage healthcare information of its 
patients in different branches around the world.
- Hospital and doctors’ information: The database consists of tables for doctors and the hospital 
where the doctors work in. These records reflect the management system of medical staff, which 
are vital to the healthcare industry.
- Medical conditions of patients: The database records information on medical conditions of 
patients. Recording medical conditions is fundamental to help healthcare providers such as doctors 
and nurses to provide appropriate effective medical care. 
- Insurance information: The database includes tables for insurance companies and insurance 
coverage that patients are entitled to. With insurance, patients can have financial protection as it 
helps cover the cost of medical services, treatments, and medications for patients. Insurance 
companies vary based on the hospital’s branch from which patients get treatment.

**2. Entity Relationship (ER) Model**

The database contains 12 tables, each designed with different attributes to capture and manage 
healthcare-related data. The ER model for our database is illustrated in the following figure. Each 
entity in database includes entity name, attributes, attributes’ data types, relationships with other 
entities, and primary keys and foreign keys used to link two entities together. Relationships 
between entities in our database include one-to-one, many-to-one/one-to-many, and many-to￾many relationships.
